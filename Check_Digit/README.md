# Check_Digit

This is a little code that calculates the check digit for a New York SUI ID.
You enter in your 7 digit ID and the program will calculate the check digit as per this documentation from the state of NY:

It was created so I could run through my client base an double check that our records were correct before loading inforamtion for clients to the state of NY.
